1. For linear model experiments:

    To download:
    ```sh download.sh```

    To run: (do experiment on different datasets)    `sh run.sh`

    To run single experiment on MNIST dataset:
    
    either `python traditional_acc.py` or `python AUC.py`

2. For neural network auc optimization:

    To run: (do experiment on MNIST dataset)    `sh mnist_run.sh`

Please notice that we use Python 2.7
