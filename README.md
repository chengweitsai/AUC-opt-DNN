1. For linear model experiments:

    To download:

        type `sh download.sh`

    To run: (do experiment on different datasets)

        type `sh run.sh`

    To run single experiment on MNIST dataset:
    
        either type `python traditional_acc.py`
    
        or type `python AUC.py`

2. For neural network auc optimization:

    To run: (do experiment on MNIST dataset)
    
        type `sh mnist_run.sh`

Please notice that we use Python 2.7
